# Introduction
This is a simple cli tool for creating and managing container environments for KDE development.

# Goals
1. Expand [kdepim docker scripts](https://community.kde.org/KDE_PIM/Docker) and provide a better cli.
2. Add support for podman along with docker.
3. Use nvidia-container-toolkit for nvidia systems.
4. Be minimal and easy to extend.

# Why Rust
Rust is a fast and great language, but more importantly, it produces binaries which are easier to distribute. 
Golang might have been a good choice too but I am just more familiar with Rust.

# Special Thanks
- Daniel Vr√°til: For kdepim docker scripts.
